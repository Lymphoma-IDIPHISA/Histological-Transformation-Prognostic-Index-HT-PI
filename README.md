# Histological transformation predictive model
A predictive model of histological transformation (HT) in FL patients has been generated by Cox regression analysis using mutation status and FLIPI information. *HIST1H1E*, *NOTCH2* and *TP53* were statistically associated with a higher risk of HT, and mutations in *TNFRSF14* with a lower risk of HT and so were included into the predictive model. Several clinico-pathological factors have been associated with a higher risk of HT, such as high-risk FLIPI, so was included into the HT predictive model.

The risk score was calculated as the sum of regression coefficients of high-risk FLIPI (Cox regression coefficient +2.5), alterations in *HIST1H1E*, *NOTCH2* and *TP53* (+3.2), considered as a single adverse variable, and mutations in *TNFRSF14* (-1,8). The optimal cut-offs to stratify patients in three risk groups were < 0 for low-risk group, ≥ 0 and <2.4 for intermediate risk, and ≥ 2.4 for high-risk group, as calculated by ROC analysis.
